This document describes things I want to learn when working on this Hobby-Project.
1. Creating a custom GUI framework and it's Components using a basic graphics library like pygame.
2. Developing UI's that are directly connected to python data structures like Lists.
3. Being able to write a fairly complex program by myself (solo development).
4. Writing flexible, readable and dynamic code.
